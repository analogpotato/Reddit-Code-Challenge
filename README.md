# Reddit-Code-Challenge


This is my take home challenge for an interview process. 


# Objective

- Per the objective outlined, my goal is to 
- Create an iOS application that lists reddit posts in a table view. 
- Each table view cell should contain the post name along with the subreddit category name. 
- There should be some UI that allows a user to type in a subreddit category (perhaps in a text field or an alert view with plain text input) and display only posts belonging to that subreddit category when they click submit (perhaps the table will get reloaded with new data, or show a new table view).
- When a user clicks on a cell, the url attached to the post should open in a basic web view (don't worry if content looks funny as not all urls will be responsive in their design)."
